# How to contribute
Easily, fork the repository, make change and make a pull request. For all intents and purposes this project follows the suckless coding style <http://suckless.org/coding_style/>
with few modifications. 

1. Include guards are must.
2. Use C11 with GNU extensions. Mainly because SocketCAN demands these.
